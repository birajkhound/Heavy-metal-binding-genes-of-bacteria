# Heavy-metal-binding-genes-of-bacteria
Heavy metal binding genes serve as the essential genetic toolkit for survival in environments contaminated by toxic metals.

Bacteria are the ultimate survivalists. When they find themselves in toxic environments—like soil contaminated by industrial runoff or mine tailings—they don't just give up; they evolve sophisticated genetic machinery to "trap" or "detoxify" heavy metals.

This process is largely governed by plasmids and operons that encode specific proteins designed to recognize and bind metal ions. Here we have a collection of some amino acid sequences of genes that are capable of binding heavy metal ions such as Zinc, Nickel, Manganese, Copper, Nickel, Cobalt. Our Excel files contain the following columns: SN, accession, protein, gene, organism, sequence, site, metal, Taxonomy_Link, Domain, etc.

I have collected gene sequences from the MbPA database (http://bioinfor.imu.edu.cn/mbpa/#/download) and extracted bacterial sequences using the NCBI taxonomy database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy) through the Biopython package (https://scikit.bio/index.html).
